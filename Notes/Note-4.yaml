Backends and Remote State
=============================

The State file keeps track of everything Terraform does
Local State is not good for production environments when working in a team
it needs a locking mechanism to avoid running into race conditions

Solution: sotre  the state remotely using the correct backend

Backends define how operations are executed and where the Terraform State is stored
